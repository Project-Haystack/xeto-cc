## Introduction

This library defines the Xeto device spec for the Grizzl-E Smart 40A Level 2 AC EVSE.

## Notes

 * Might want to make an attribute for the enclosure which is separate from the attribute for the boxed up product
 * Some of the point specs are abstract and require electrical location data
