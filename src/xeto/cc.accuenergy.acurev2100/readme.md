## Introduction

This library defines Xeto device specs for the AcuRev 2100 Series Multi-Circuit Submeter by Accuenergy.

Please note not all points supported by the meter are defined.  These specs are preliminary and subject to change.

There are Project Haystack community initiatives to validate and improve these specs so that system integrators can have confidence in using them.  Also, we would welcome any feedback that you have to improve these specs.

## Notes

 * Need to find a way to specify the Channel #
 * Elec location depends on how the elec meter is wired - how should these tags be added later?
